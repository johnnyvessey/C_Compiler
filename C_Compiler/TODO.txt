PARSER TODO:

	Important next steps;

	- Parse struct variable initialization (i.e. struct structVar v = {1, 2}; struct structVar2 v2 = {1, {1,2}, {3,4}};)
		-> figure out what type that rvalue should be? (struct literal??, but what if it references other struct variable) -> (i.e. struct structVar1 v = {1, testVar}; )

	- add ControlFlowBlock class that has statementgroup as member
		- if statements, loops create new ControlFlowBlocks

	- figure out Lexing/Parsing for negative int/float literals [DONE??]

	- unit tests
	- Properly parse string literals and char literals
	- figure out calling external functions (malloc??)
	- add const variables
	


AST:

- Figure out how to recursively traverse the AST in the proper order to generate the assembly / IR code
- when doing assignment and function parameters, make copy of variable / store value in pointer (LLVM)
