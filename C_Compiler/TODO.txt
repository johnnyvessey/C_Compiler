TODO:

PARSER TODO:
	
	- Add printing AST for binary operations
- IMPORTANT: HANDLING POINTERS DIFFERENTLY
 -> don't just use bool isPointer, need a parent class / nesting to allow pointers to pointers
- Properly add scope functionality -> every time variable, function, struct defined
	- properly push and pop scope stack when there are function calls, loops, if statements, braces, etc...
- Properly parse binary expressions with correct order of operations
- Add function calls and definitions
- Add support for arrays
- if, while, for statements
- Handle boolean logic and operators
- Don't allow redefinition of variables within scope
- Properly parse string literals and char literals


AST:

- Figure out how to recursively traverse the AST in the proper order to generate the assembly / IR code
