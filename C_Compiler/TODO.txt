	Important next steps;
	- struct variable access (period)
	- unary expressions
	- unit tests
	- assignment for pointer dereferences and struct variable accesses (as well as chained versions of them)
	- & symbol to get reference (probably just need to add 1 to pointer level ???)
	- Add support for arrays
	- while, for statements
- Properly parse string literals and char literals


AST:

- Figure out how to recursively traverse the AST in the proper order to generate the assembly / IR code
